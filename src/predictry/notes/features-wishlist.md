##Data on Neo4j

- Create endpoints to manipulate certain item and user list properties.

    For item: add/remove specific tags, locations.

##Engine & Algorithms
- Apply user problem-domain approach to making recommendations
    
    Background daemons analyze data, define what not to recommend, and evaluate responses to recommendations.
    
    Live daemons use pre-computed information to make decisions on the fly
