Index EVERYTHING: Queries can become faster by a factor of 3x

Don't chase after ghosts: searching for data that's not there is a big waste of time. The system has to run
wide search, which takes long, and returns nothing

In any query, specify all known lables, relationsip types. Query speeds have been observed to improve 2x

Any cypher query's speed depends on the number of nodes we visit. The more nodes we need to count, the longer it
will take. If we're just passing by (path finding), the number of nodes is much less of an issue.
